        <p className="text-cod">The cocktail originated in the early 20th century in Cuba, 
        after the country won independence in the Spanishâ€“American War. It subsequently became popular across Cuba, the United States, and other countries. Its simple recipe and inexpensive, ubiquitous ingredients have made it one of the world's most popular alcoholic drinks. 
        Drink critics often consider the drink mediocre, but it has been noted for its historical significance.
